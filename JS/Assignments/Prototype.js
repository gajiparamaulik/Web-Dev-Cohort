
// 01. JS Prototype
// Easy **Hints
// Problem statement
// You need to create a constructor function Animal that takes a name parameter. Add a method makeSound to its prototype, 
// which always returns "Some generic sound". 
// Challenge
// • Implement a constructor function Animal that initializes the name property.
// • Attach a method makeSound to its prototype that returns "Some generic sound".




// 02. JS Prototype
// Easy **Hints
// Problem statement
// You are designing a simple robot system. Each robot has a name and a batteryLevel. The robot should have a method charge() 
// that increases the battery level by 20, but it cannot exceed 100.
// Challenge
// • Implement a constructor function Robot that initializes name and batteryLevel.
// • Attach a method charge() to its prototype that increases batteryLevel by 20, ensuring it does not go above 100.




// 03. JS Prototype
// Easy -Hints
// Problem statement
// You need to create a Counter constructor function that initializes a count property to 0. The counter should have 
// two prototype methods:
// • increment() increases the count by 1.
// • decrement() decreases the count by 1.
// Challenge
// • Implement a constructor function Counter that initializes count to
// • Attach increment () and decrement() methods to the prototype.




// 04. JS Prototype
// Easy Hints
// Problem statement
// Create a playlist constructor that initializes with an empty songs array. Add a method addSong(song) to the prototype 
// that adds a new song to the playlist.
// Challenge
// • Implement a constructor function Playlist that initializes an empty songs array.
// • Attach a method addSong(song) to its prototype that adds the song to the songs array.
