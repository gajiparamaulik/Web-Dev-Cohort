// Easy **Hints
// Problem statement
// You need to create a constructor function Animal that takes a name parameter. Add a method makeSound to its prototype, 
// which always returns "Some generic sound". 
// Challenge
// • Implement a constructor function Animal that initializes the name property.
// • Attach a method makeSound to its prototype that returns "Some generic sound".




// 02. JS Prototype
// Easy **Hints
// Problem statement
// You are designing a simple robot system. Each robot has a name and a batteryLevel. The robot should have a method charge() 
// that increases the battery level by 20, but it cannot exceed 100.
// Challenge
// • Implement a constructor function Robot that initializes name and batteryLevel.
// • Attach a method charge() to its prototype that increases batteryLevel by 20, ensuring it does not go above 100.
